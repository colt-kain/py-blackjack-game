# Blackjack (in python)

This was definitely an interesting project. I could have handled this more carefully but I wound up with a pretty sloppy approach.

However, if you do decide to play this game (for some reason), here are the instructions:

1. Download this project as a zip folder
2. Unzip the contents
3. Install Python3 on your machine
4. In the project directory, run `python3 blackjack.py`
5. Enjoy

If you find any bugs and have a GitHub account, please let me know and I will attempt to fix them. Thank you.
